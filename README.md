# Cache Simulation

A Swift app to easily simulate multiple caches with different settings, created as a supplement to a project in Intro to Comp Org.

## Usage

The app accepts a file with a list of addresses in hexadecimal format (e.g. 0x12345678). Content in the file that does not match this format is ignored. It assumes a 32 bit address space for main memory. Many other settings are configurable in the GUI.

I have only currently tested this app on macOS. It may also potentially work on iOS or iPadOS.

## Building

Open and run the project in Xcode.
